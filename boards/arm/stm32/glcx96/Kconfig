	---help---
		If BOARD_LATE_INITIALIZE initialize is defined, then the function
		board_late_initialize() will be called to perform board-specific
		initialization. board_late_initialize() runs on the IDLE thread.
		Depending on the features that are enabled, this  board
		initialization logic may need to start a kernel thread that has
		more capability than the IDLE thread.  This setting then provides
		the priority of the board initialization thread.

		NOTE:  GLCX96_BOARDINIT_PRIO should have a relatively high
		priority to assure that board level initialization completes
		before the application requires the initialized board services.
		Default: 196

config GLCX96_BOARDINIT_STACK
	int "Board initialization thread Size"
	default DEFAULT_TASK_STACKSIZE
	---help---
		If BOARD_LATE_INITIALIZE initialize is defined, then the function
		board_late_initialize() will be called to perform board-specific
		initialization. board_late_initialize() runs on the IDLE thread.
		Depending on the features that are enabled, this  board
		initialization logic may need to start a kernel thread that has
		more capability than the IDLE thread.  This setting then provides
		the size of the stack to use with the initialization kernel thread.
